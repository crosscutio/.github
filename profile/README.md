_Global Access Commitment_

Crosscut manages access to our application in a manner that ensures Global Access. "Global Access" means: (a) the knowledge and information gained from the application are promptly and broadly disseminated via our publicly available application accessed at https://app.crosscut.io, and (b) our application is made available and accessible at an affordable price to people most in need within developing countries. We fulfill this commitment by making the application free of charge to users.

Crosscut catchment area maps are recognized as a [Digital Public Good](https://app.digitalpublicgoods.net/a/11028).  According to the Digital Public Goods Alliance: 
        
        The Digital Public Goods Standard is a set of specifications and guidelines designed to maximise consensus 
        about whether a digital solution conforms to the definition of a digital public good. According to the UN 
        Secretary General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation, digital public goods are open-source software, open 
        standards, open data, open AI systems, and open content collections that adhere to privacy and other 
        applicable best practices, do no harm, and are of high relevance for attainment of the United Nations 
        2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## Open Datasets
Crosscut offers several open datasets to assist Global Health practitioners to make programs more effective and efficient. Specifically, Crosscut offers "settlement-based" catchment areas and microplans (i.e. population and building estimates) that can be accessed at https://app.crosscut.io and clicking on 'SEE AN EXAMPLE'. We have identified the largest settlements in each countries, placed a name on these settlements where we have been able to find one, defined the catchment area for each, and provide the estimated population and buildings in that catchment area. For population, we include data from several sources and broken out by age and gender. For buildings, we similarly include data from several sources.

The catchment area boundaries, uniquely generated by Crosscut, with all corresponding metadata described below, can be accessed by clicking on the three dots to the right of the catchment area. Here you can download the data in an easily digestible format to include PDF and geojson. The metadata for each catchment area can be downloaded by navigating to the 'SEE MICROPLAN' tab.
